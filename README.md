# wmenu

A [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/) clone for the Windows operating system written with pure win32 API.

wmenu is a hybrid GUI/terminal application inspired by [dmenu](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/). But it's more than that. It's better to see wmenu as "a GUI echo" utility.

If you pass a list of items to it via: `-elements` option, wmenu shows you a ComboBox and and you're able to select one of them. After that, it echos back that item on your terminal.

If you omit `-elements`, wmenu starts acting like a GUI TextBox. Now you can type something and by pressing ENTER, it will echo the content of TextBox on the screen.

## Demo

## Why?

### 1. The main reason is that: I missed my Linux workflow

When I met `dmenu` for the first time, I said to myself: "This simple tool can change my workflow completely", And surprisingly it did!

I started to use `dmenu` to automate almost everything in my machine.

From searching through applications, managing software(installing/deleting/updating), running custom scripts, browsing through my favorite directories, playing music, etc...

But the problem is that `dmenu` uses Xlib under the hood which is not available on Windows. There are some hacky ways like compiling `dmenu` using Cygwin, but.. no. I didn't like those ways.

So I started from scratch to clone `dmenu` using win32 API, without any emulation. This is how wmenu was born :)

### 2. The second reason is that I wanted to encourage people to challenge their habits. (even if you are a programmer or not.)

Microsoft tried so hard during the last years(And they are trying now more than before) to force people to use Windows in a specific way.

They pay huge amounts of money to engineers to create a palace!(__default__ environment)

In the end, you will become a good user(follower!) But man! it's the computer world. No one can tell you __HOW__ you can use your computer.

## Prerequisites

- MSVC

## How use it?

Since `wmenu` uses the `WINDOWS` subsystem when compiling, you can't use `stdout` directly.

So you should pipe it with `more` command:

```batch
wmenu.exe -elements "wmenu,dmenu,dwm" | more
```

Or if you want to use a specific delimiter:

```batch
wmenu.exe -element-delimiter ":" -elements "wmenu:dmenu:dwm" | more
```

For more information about how using wmenu:

```batch
wmenu.exe -help | more
```

## Usage

Let's create a file called `apps.bat` and paste these lines into it:

```batch
@echo off
start /B wmenu.exe -elements "notepad;explorer;paint;" | more > %temp%/apps.txt

for /f "tokens=*" %%s in (%temp%\apps.txt) do (
  IF "%%s"=="notepad" (
 start %%s
  ) ELSE IF "%%s"=="explorer" (
 start %%s
  ) ELSE IF "%%s"=="paint" (
 start mspaint
  ) ELSE (
 REM default case...
  )
)

del "%temp%\apps.txt"
```

You can use [clavier+](https://github.com/guilryder/clavier-plus) to bind it to a key.

As i said, i [use](https://github.com/LinArcX/winconf/tree/master/wmenu) `wmenu` for almost anything. Enjoy hacking your workflow :)

## Philosophy behind code structure

1. I intentionally changed/removed some policies that are common in the UNIX world (you can see them in most Linux software like dmenu).
2. I don't like passing a list of elements by piping(something used in suckless dmenu). Instead, I prefer to __explicitly__ pass them via `-elements` option.
3. I'm not a big fan of having two kinds of option names(short names like `-e` and long ones like `--elements`). Instead,Â I prefer to use full and descriptive names. (`-elements`)
